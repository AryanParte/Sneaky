To create a Cluely-style MVP (Minimum Viable Product) â€” a discreet AI-powered desktop assistant for real-time help during interviews, meetings, or calls â€” hereâ€™s a structured product roadmap and tech plan that gets you to a lean, functional version fast:

â¸»

ðŸŽ¯ MVP Goal

A lightweight desktop assistant that can:
	â€¢	Read screen content and audio in real-time
	â€¢	Provide contextual suggestions (e.g., answers, prompts, data lookups)
	â€¢	Run discreetly and be minimally intrusive

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

Frontend / UI:
	â€¢	Electron.js (for cross-platform desktop apps)
	â€¢	React (for building the UI in Electron)
	â€¢	Tailwind CSS (fast UI design)

Backend / AI:
	â€¢	Python (FastAPI) or Node.js for server-side logic
	â€¢	OpenAI API / Local LLM for real-time responses
	â€¢	Whisper / Vosk for speech-to-text (if real-time audio is used)
	â€¢	Tesseract.js or Screen parsing with OCR for screen reading

System Access:
	â€¢	Tesseract OCR for screen capture interpretation
	â€¢	PyGetWindow / pyautogui (Python) or robotjs (Node) for screen & input control
	â€¢	Electron IPC to bridge native features and frontend
